ZEN-garden is written in Python and is available as a package. 

Installing python
==============

If it is your first time using Python, we recommend using `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`as the package manager and setting up ZEN-garden as a conda environment. 
Furthermore, it is helpful to install an integrated development environment (IDE), such as `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_. Most users of ZEN-garden use PyCharm, but other IDEs such as `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ work as well. 

- Anaconda (Needed for ZEN-garden environment creation) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
- Gurobi (Optimization Software) [Install Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) (not necessary but recommended)
- (GitHub Desktop) [Install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

To install the package, run the following command in the terminal while in the root directory of the repository:

  pip install -e

When installing the conda environment, this is done automatically.

See the [how to ZEN-garden documentation](https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden/blob/main/documentation/how_to_ZEN_garden.md#needed-installations) for more information on installing.
