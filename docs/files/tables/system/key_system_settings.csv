Key;Type;Default Value;Description
set_conversion_technologies;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of conversion technologies included in the optimization
set_storage_technologies;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of storage technologies included in the optimization
set_retrofitting_technologies;``list[str]``;[]``;list of retrofitting technologies included in the optimization 
set_transport_technologies;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of transport technologies included in the optimization
use_capacities_existing;``bool``;``True``;per default a brownfield optimization is conducted, by setting this parameter to ``False``existing technology capacities are ignored and a greenfield optimization is conducted
;;
set_nodes;``list[str]``;``[]``;per default all nodes are selected, however, by overwriting the empty list value you can condi√∫ct the optimization for a subset of subset of nodes 
conduct_scenario_analysis;``bool``;``False``;per default only the optimization is only conducted for the default sceanrio, set to ``True`` to conduct scenario analysis
;;
total_hours_per_year;``int``;8760;per default the total hours per year are set to 8760, overwrite this parameter if you want to investigate a shorter period
unaggregated_time_steps_per_year;``int``;8760;per default the number of unaggregated timesteps is set to 8760
conduct_time_series_aggregation;``bool``;``True``;per default the time-series-aggregation (TSA) is conducted, set to ``False``to skip the TSA
aggregated_time_steps_per_year;``int``;10;per default the TSA aggregates the number of time-steps to 10, overwrite this value to increase or decrease the intra-yearly temporal resolution
;;
reference_year;``int``;2023;per default the reference year is set to 2023
optimized_years;``int``;3;per default, the optimization is conducted for 3 years, change this value to investigate shorter or longer time horizons
interval_between_years;``int``;1;per default, the optimization is conducted for each year, change this value to only investigate every second (2) year or every third (3) year, etc.
